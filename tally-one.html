				<h1>Tally</h1>
				<p>Tally is an iOS app that makes credit cards less expensive and easier to manage. I'm the Head of Design and I lay the foundation for design processes, help inform the team on best design practices, organize and facilitate user interviews, and roll up my sleeves for actual design work.</p>

			<p class="description">I joined Tally as their 3rd employee (after the founders) in August of 2015. All we had at the time was an idea and a half-working prototype. I decided the best plan of attack was to take a step back and first figure out <strong>who</strong> we were designing for, so I created a testing plan for us to have video calls with potential users. We set out to Craigslst and received hundreds of responses. The next week, we spoke with roughly 30 people about credit cards, finances, money, and budgeting. Now that we had a rough idea of who we were building for, it was time to tackle what we should be building. We got back to work on our prototype.</p>

			<p class="description">After having a functioning prototype, it was time to test again. We published another Craigslist ad, sifted through the responses, and scheduled people to come in to test our prototype. I created a script and testing plan, and once the users we’re in our office, I facilitated the user studies.
			<br><br>We then went through many iterations, and 2 full redesigns in the span of 8 months. During this time, we decided to change our company and app name from Augmint, but were still running through options. Money is a touch subject, and we wanted to find ways to make it more approachable. One iteration included colors to denote the different section users were in, fun illustrations, and small animations throughout the sign-up process.</p>

			<p class="description">After spending some time with design and refining things like copy and interactions throughout the app, we decided what we’d put together could be much better, and although it would push the launch back, it was worth it to hit the drawing board on the design side.</p>
